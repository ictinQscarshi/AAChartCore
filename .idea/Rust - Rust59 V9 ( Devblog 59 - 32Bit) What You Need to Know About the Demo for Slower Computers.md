Rust is a popular survival game that requires a powerful computer to run smoothly. However, some players have found a way to enjoy the game on slower machines by using a modded version called Rust - Rust59 V9. This version is based on Devblog 59, which was released in 2016, and has been modified to run on 32-bit systems and lower graphics settings.
 
Rust - Rust59 V9 was created by Ntlhegestoe, a SoundCloud user who uploaded a demo of the mod on his account[^2^]. According to him, the mod is intended for players who want to experience Rust but cannot afford a high-end PC. He also claims that the mod has some features that are not available in the official version, such as custom skins, maps, and items.
