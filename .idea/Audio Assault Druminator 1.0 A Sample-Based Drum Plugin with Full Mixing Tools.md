One of the unique features of Druminator is the Punch knob that is built into every channel. This knob allows you to add some extra punch and impact to your drums, making them cut through the mix better. You can also use the Trigger channels for snare and kick to blend your own samples with the original drums, giving you more control and variety.
 
Another feature that sets Druminator apart from other drum plugins is the FX section that is available for each channel. Here you can apply effects such as compression, clipping, saturation, transient shaping and reverb to each drum or to the whole kit. You can use these effects to shape the tone and dynamics of your drums, making them sound more aggressive, punchy, warm or spacious.
 
Druminator also features a full range of mixing tools on every channel, such as volume, pan, pitch, attack, sustain and release. You can use these tools to adjust the balance and tuning of your drums, making them fit better with your song. You can also use the multi-output feature to mix outside the plugin if you prefer.
